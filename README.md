# basic nintendo 64 game demo

this is the bare bones [Buu 342's libultra sausage64 demo rom](https://github.com/buu342/N64-Sausage64), stripped of all the model showcase functions,

so i can add some code to try to make it look like a third person shooter

hopefully i will add more gameplay styles when i have covered all the basic stuff

# compilation

im on lubuntu using [Crashoveride Modern SDK](https://crashoveride95.github.io/modernsdk/), if you are interested i can help you out setting up a docker

##

# use this code as you will

give credit to the ones before you :)
