### basic Nintendo 64 game demo

this is the bare bones [Buu 342's Libultra Sausage64 demo rom](https://github.com/buu342/N64-Sausage64) stripped of all the model showcase functions

i added some code to try to make it look like a third person shooter

hopefully i will add more gameplay styles when i have covered all the basic stuff

### compilation

im on lubuntu using [Crashoveride Modern SDK](https://crashoveride95.github.io/modernsdk/), if you are interested i can help you out setting up a docker
